# eslint-takeoff
Utility that auto-generates ESLint todo-lists for an existing code base.

# Installation

Install globally (or locally, but this may not be the sort of package you'd keep around):

```
npm install -g eslint-takeoff
```

# Usage

Run at the project root with an `.eslintrc.yml` file.

Currently compatible with projects with rules configured in `.eslintrc.yml` only. Other configuration modes (JSON, JS) could be added in the future.

# Development

Yarn is required, as is Node 8+:

* Yarn 1.5.2
* Node 8.9.4+
